# Psychological Research Project

This project contains examples of psychological research conducted using Python and R programming languages. The examples cover various topics and research designs commonly used in psychology research.

### 🧭 Project Overview

The project includes the following examples:

1. Correlation Analysis: Analyzing the relationship between two or more variables using Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall's correlation coefficient.
2. Regression Analysis: Examining the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using linear regression, logistic regression, or multiple regression.
3. T-Test Analysis: Comparing the means of two groups using a t-test, paired t-test, or independent samples t-test.
4. ANOVA Analysis: Testing the difference in means among two or more groups using one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA, or repeated measures ANOVA.
5. Experimental Design: Conducting experiments using different designs, such as between-subjects, within-subjects, and mixed designs.
6. Survey Design: Creating and analyzing surveys using different types of questions and survey designs.
7. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to explore and present data using ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn, or plotly.
### ⏱️ Estimated time needed: 8h

Note: The time estimation may vary due to your setup and previous experience.

### 🚧 Prerequisites

Before running this project, you must have the following:

Python and R installed on your system
Knowledge of statistics and research design in psychology
Knowledge of Python and R libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, ggplot2, tidyverse, dplyr, etc.

### 🎛️ Project Setup

Clone the project repository to your local machine
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it
Install the necessary packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt for Python or install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "psych", "lme4")) for R.
Navigate to the folder containing the example you want to run and execute the Python or R script.
Visualize the results using the appropriate visualization library.
